We are a dynamic research group at the [Leiden Institute of Physics](http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl). Our aim is to explore and understand [quantum materials](http://condensedconcepts.blogspot.nl/2013/05/what-is-quantum-matter.html), including strange metals, high-temperature superconductors, and quantum critical electron matter.
