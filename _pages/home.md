**Meta** For the re statistics of many existing empirical literature, through the statistical analysis of the statistical indicators in the relevant literature using the corresponding statistical formula, the real correlation between the two variables can be analyzed according to the statistical significance obtained.

**Measure** According to a certain theory, through a certain operation procedure, a quantitative value is determined for the traits that are difficult to quantify.

**Model** Through subjective consciousness, with the help of entity or virtual expression, it forms an object that objectively expounds the morphological structure to express the purpose. (Source: https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B/1741186)
