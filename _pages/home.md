**Metascience** Metascience (also known as meta-research) is the use of scientific methodology to study science itself. Metascience seeks to increase the quality of scientific research while reducing inefficiency. It is also known as "research on research" and "the science of science", as it uses research methods to study how research is done and find where improvements can be made. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metascience)

**Measurement** Measurement is the quantification of attributes of an object or event, which can be used to compare with other objects or events. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement)

**Modeling**A model is an informative representation of an object, person or system. The term originally denoted the plans of a building in late 16th-century English, and derived via French and Italian ultimately from Latin modulus, a measure. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model)
